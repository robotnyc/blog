Our next adventure will be Europe! Five countries in 16 days - France, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway. We're starting in Paris in August and will spend a week. Next, we're off to Amsterdam and Brussels for the weekend, Stockholm for 4 days, and Oslo for 2!<br/><br/>I'll be writing about the amazing sites, and reviewing the vegan food adventures in each city we visit. We'll be staying at people's houses, so we can really feel the essence of each city and the way people live.
