<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The rumors are true - Berlin vegan food is some of the best in the world and super abundant. With over 50 fully vegan restaurants to choose from, what do you choose? Here's my top ten vegan restaurants you have to try when you're traveling. T</span><span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">here were so many more I didn't get to visit, I just have to go back and visit the other 40 missing from the list!</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Kopps</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3pkiqRB7K84/WVm-VkxXk8I/AAAAAAAABRU/EeZhnBAHBH85lVw2SfyTmY1uTK9W8i7tACLcBGAs/s1600/34277870570_71968305d1_o%2B%25281%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3pkiqRB7K84/WVm-VkxXk8I/AAAAAAAABRU/EeZhnBAHBH85lVw2SfyTmY1uTK9W8i7tACLcBGAs/s640/34277870570_71968305d1_o%2B%25281%2529.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Kopps is a fancy vegan restaurant that has the most spectacular all-you-can-eat brunch for&nbsp;€15! I had a huge selection of options from a croquette with gravy, fresh bread and cheese, eggy hot dishes and cold pasta salads. Plus desserts, coffees and even beers. You can go up there as much as you want (and no one changes their plate like in the U.S.) and it always seems to be hot food and full. We ate here with a fantastic vegan meetup group, so we had a big table, lots of food, and great conversation with people from five different countries.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">I haven't tried the dinner which is completely different, but it's a set menu and much more expensive. I will definitely come back here to try both dinner and brunch.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Viasko</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PjHU32KeLsw/WVm20vpwIaI/AAAAAAAABQo/25qBmWychH8OSw62VosyUJkwHsFq-HkmQCLcBGAs/s1600/33850721273_c8e2efe41f_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PjHU32KeLsw/WVm20vpwIaI/AAAAAAAABQo/25qBmWychH8OSw62VosyUJkwHsFq-HkmQCLcBGAs/s640/33850721273_c8e2efe41f_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Viasko is a vegan restaurant that plays punk and dark wave and won't let you in with faux fur, for reals. The staff is super nice and helped my terrible German become a little bit better at least in ordering food the right way! There was a short menu, so the best thing on there was the schnitzel (seitan) with white asparagus. It was my one and only schnitzel experience, and it was really well done. I hear their brunch is even better on the weekend and the tiramisu dessert was absolutely amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>No Milk Today</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OZ_emf_Xv_Q/WVmpLNak74I/AAAAAAAABO4/uunY_5WZsOQAbCe2MFFkMGfBosUXfVEvQCLcBGAs/s1600/34568270162_c37b31cf85_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OZ_emf_Xv_Q/WVmpLNak74I/AAAAAAAABO4/uunY_5WZsOQAbCe2MFFkMGfBosUXfVEvQCLcBGAs/s640/34568270162_c37b31cf85_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://no-milk-today-berlin.de/?lang=en_us" target="_blank">No Milk Today</a> is a cute all vegan cafe in Kreuzberg. They serve fantastic lattes with croissants, quiches, bagel sandwiches and salad. It's a casual place to hang out in the cute library in the back or outside on the patio or beach chairs on a beautiful day. Try their Vietnamese coffee with a croissant for a special treat.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Sfizy Vegan</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2z4RWToCS1I/WVmpWOCx7-I/AAAAAAAABO8/xOorKVGDzA0xw2WffqQ50r8AoZISXZ5UQCLcBGAs/s1600/34475495832_24b153471c_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2z4RWToCS1I/WVmpWOCx7-I/AAAAAAAABO8/xOorKVGDzA0xw2WffqQ50r8AoZISXZ5UQCLcBGAs/s640/34475495832_24b153471c_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.happycow.net/reviews/sfizy-veg-berlin-28222" target="_blank">Sfizy Vegan</a> is an all vegan Italian pizzeria from real Italianos. This is the best pizza in out of Italy because there are so many fantastic flavors that I was never able to try in Italy. This is the best pizza place I've ever been to because the dough is exceptional and they serve soft calzones stuffed with sausages, cashew cheese and spinach that are to die for. Pictured before the calzone is a pesto pizza with eggplant and peppers. They speak German, Italian and English here and the environment is that of a small family-run Italian restaurant with random tables and chairs and old Italian portraits on the walls. They serve great wine and sparkling Mate. I didn't try their homemade tiramisu, so I will need to travel back here to get it because it looked amazing as well! Don't skip this place, and make a reservation!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Voner</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0mHUWuWIjuY/WVmqhtVM90I/AAAAAAAABPE/2n1RI3VGkhsdjrizkykJX6ZlFmZ_RYhnACLcBGAs/s1600/33887631564_99bd91353e_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0mHUWuWIjuY/WVmqhtVM90I/AAAAAAAABPE/2n1RI3VGkhsdjrizkykJX6ZlFmZ_RYhnACLcBGAs/s640/33887631564_99bd91353e_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.voener.de/" target="_blank">Voner</a> wins the prize for the most surprising meal of the trip. For only&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">€4.50, you can eat an insanely massive vegan doner with freshly made sesame bread, seitan from a spit (that thing in doner place with the fat meat hanging from a pole), vegan yogurt sauce on top of fresh vegetables. The place is small and the food is cheap, but damn was this place surprising, filling and a fantastic find in the arty district of F</span><span style="color: #222222;">riedrichshain. I was disappointed that we didn't find more wall art in this neighborhood (more graffiti) but the doner and club mate made it all better.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>GaYaYa</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dqB_KBp-Spk/WVm62wh0sgI/AAAAAAAABRA/BarHjl0zxOExm3ZhYuViSwgzo2WcVHRcwCLcBGAs/s1600/34696399092_f3d9405e02_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dqB_KBp-Spk/WVm62wh0sgI/AAAAAAAABRA/BarHjl0zxOExm3ZhYuViSwgzo2WcVHRcwCLcBGAs/s640/34696399092_f3d9405e02_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMvb2QmOzUAhWmgFQKHaLwC0cQFggpMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gayaya-berlin.de%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeo2BDRwN8mVbIICM8cY1dMeF6zQ" target="_blank">GaYaYa</a> is "pan-Asian" vegan food located in Mitte. I'm guessing this is a mix of Cambodian and Malaysian food, but I've really never had anything like it. The food was absolutely amazing, and I've never had these flavors together. We both got the 3 course meal which consisted of their two top dishes, a curry and noodle dish with an amazing coconut milk and mango dessert. I can't really describe the dishes, but as you see in the picture - there is a lot going on! This place is across the street from&nbsp;Sammlung Boros, an old Nazi bunker turned POW Russian prison, turned banana storage, turned 90s underground rave, turn modern art museum that we toured. We ran into this place accidentally, but it turned out to be one of my favorite spots!</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Momos</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D0werG-OGIM/WVmvVeaFfTI/AAAAAAAABPw/Jz-WvrMcuyINCKSa6e-q74u3JHxLNpxkQCLcBGAs/s1600/34443117252_b9234dcea0_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D0werG-OGIM/WVmvVeaFfTI/AAAAAAAABPw/Jz-WvrMcuyINCKSa6e-q74u3JHxLNpxkQCLcBGAs/s640/34443117252_b9234dcea0_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/"><span id="goog_954374589"></span>Momos<span id="goog_954374590"></span></a> is the first place we stopped after the long flight from LA to Berlin. 15 hours of travel to get vegan dumplings filled with potatoes, carrots, and some with tofu. After we ordered the 18 momo plate with all the vegan options and sauces, we saw that we could have ordered a plate with over 30 for a little more money. I would definitely come back here, get the 30 plate and stuff my face with it. This is also a moment where I want to acknowledge Momos being our first ever <a href="http://en.charitea.com/product/charitea-mate/" target="_blank">ChariTea Sparkling Mate</a> experience which basically changed our lives. This is not a product in the states, unless you want to pay $10 a bottle to importers on Amazon, so drink up! This was my first Mate out of the next 20 or so that would follow for the 2.5 week trip.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Note - This place is a vegetarian dumpling place, but everything is marked vegan or not.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Brammibal's Donuts</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-njtlpxroGpg/WVmr5w-2nKI/AAAAAAAABPU/TPTgJaqSAb8a-Z3oM-AbFwblrgWEG52XQCLcBGAs/s1600/34568198352_369ff83222_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-njtlpxroGpg/WVmr5w-2nKI/AAAAAAAABPU/TPTgJaqSAb8a-Z3oM-AbFwblrgWEG52XQCLcBGAs/s640/34568198352_369ff83222_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.brammibalsdonuts.com/" target="_blank">Brammibal's Donuts</a> was similar to the vegan donut shops in LA like Donut Friend or Donut Farm. It's a coffee bar and donut shop where you can drink tasty lattes with oat milk along with your boston cream pie donut on the right (which they call Dulce de Leche) and the pistachio rose water donut on the left. The difference here is donuts are half the price of the US (at&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">€2.50 each instead of the LA $5 vegan taxed donuts) and you can walk right outside to watch the swans swim by on the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Landwehr Canal which the Germans are sunbathing all day on the nice days.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Louloute Gourmet Brunch</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_BhfzYOQpgA/WVmxIsnmvdI/AAAAAAAABQE/msZQB1Jr7i8P0wwDoGv0p1MgTqDO2uOWQCLcBGAs/s1600/34503409641_f0d8c0b426_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_BhfzYOQpgA/WVmxIsnmvdI/AAAAAAAABQE/msZQB1Jr7i8P0wwDoGv0p1MgTqDO2uOWQCLcBGAs/s640/34503409641_f0d8c0b426_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">This was one of my favorite memories from the Berlin trip. Louloute Gourmet is not a restaurant, but instead a private three-course vegan meal made at the chef's house! I found this Saturday morning brunch on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Secret-Dining-Supper-Clubs-in-Berlin/events/239510734/" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a>, but you can RSVP on the site too&nbsp;<a href="https://www.louloutegourmet.com/">https://www.louloutegourmet.com/</a> . We showed up to an intimate table to seat four and we could choose between coffee, chai, three different mimosas with fresh orange juice and custom homemade flavors like infused Earl Gray syrup, or a Bloody Mary for drinks. Next, we had an appetizer course shown here with my favorite dish, vegan lox. We had a main course which was a middle eastern spicy tomato dish and freshly made chocolate croissants for dessert. The best thing about the visit was meeting fellow local vegetarian/vegan people and meeting the chef. This is highly recommend and a unique event to meet new people and eat great food!</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Lucky Leek</b></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ukS849acYOY/WVmt7ryE8nI/AAAAAAAABPc/idB-AbGis1Q0K-uRM1FoG1kPEr2R75EXwCLcBGAs/s1600/34584206736_94dc25921d_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ukS849acYOY/WVmt7ryE8nI/AAAAAAAABPc/idB-AbGis1Q0K-uRM1FoG1kPEr2R75EXwCLcBGAs/s640/34584206736_94dc25921d_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">I almost didn't want to put <a href="http://lucky-leek.com/" target="_blank">Lucky Leek</a>'s review on here because of the just annoying experience we had here, but I will put it because it's on my traveler's lists for a vegan Berlin trip. This is basically the only all vegan fine dining experience you can have in Berlin, it's&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">€50 per person for a 5 course meal..this would actually be the normal price of many dining experiences in LA, NYC, or San Francisco and the food is definitely nice..but not worth the pain. We were stuck in our seat for over three hours while they slowly brought out each tiny dish. They didn't offer any water (usual Germany style), but after hours of entrapment, I just wanted to run out of there and go to Momos where I could get 30 dumplings for like $15 or something. Maybe go to this place once their service improves and they learn how to not trap their guests. Also - Cash only for a&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">€100 meal is pretty ridiculous, so come prepared with a sack full of coins and you'll be good. This is a hit or miss place, so come without being in a rush, bring your own water, and you'll probably be happy.&nbsp;</span></span>
