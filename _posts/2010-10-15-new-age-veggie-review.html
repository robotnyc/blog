New Age Veggie is a nicer restaurant north of the French Concession in downtown Shanghai near a trendy shopping area. It is super hard to find because it is on the 5th floor and I got lost about 5 times circling the place so beware! Once we were inside I was impressed with the decor. It is a nice and fancy restaurant with soft cushions and a huge windows to see the city. This place says vegan on Happy Cow, but that is incorrect. It is vegan sometimes but they use milk in some of their deserts and coffees..and possibly in some dishes just ask. Some Chinese don't think of milk as an animal product because it is not life, so just watch out if you are avoid that. The cheese cake and pizza's have real cheese, so watch for that as well.<br/><br/>The staff was really nice but did not speak much English. This was only troublesome when we wanted to make sure that the dishes didn't have certain ingredients. They do not serve soy milk like many places in China, so that is not an option if you are coffee drink BTW. We ordered a mushroom dish with King Mushrooms, it was delicately displayed and was just ok, kind of squishy..not like the other mushroom dish I had at the Shanghainese restaurant. We also ordered these friend long spring rolls with mushrooms inside and fake shrimp dumplings, both of these were really good and really cheap (there was a lunch special and the prices were even cheaper, check with the waitress). We ordered the pumpkin curry rice dish that was pretty good but but was regular fried rice inside so it was so-so. The last meal was veggie lettuce wraps which was my favorite part. It had fake meat cubes and diced fruit with a sweet sauce. It was really good and I will definitely get that again when we go back tonight! We drank the bitter fruit drink and a rose iced tea. Both were pretty tasty and everything was displayed really fancy.<br/><br/>We were stuffed but kept looking at the vegan deserts. Some of the cakes have no cheese or milk and that is what I will be going back for. I think they are popular because people were running in and buying all of them up as we ate. They look like professional cakes and delicate. Tiramisu, opera cake, strawberry cake etc. were there..I will update when I taste them for our birthday party tonight.<br/><br/>All together I rate this place a 4 star. It is vegetarian, fancy, close to all the shopping, clean and friendly. You can try a huge array of traditional Chinese dishes in the fake form some looked weird like fake goose liver or pork fist, but some looked great like veggie burgers, hot pot, fried rice and regular fake chicken, pork or beef with a sauce.<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="Mushroom Rolls"]<img class=" " title="Mushroom Rolls" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/34486-2/P1120440.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="Faux Shrimp Dumplings"]<img class=" " title="Faux Shrimp Dumplings" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/34489-2/P1120441.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="King Mushroom Dish"]<img class=" " title="King Mushroom Dish" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/34492-2/P1120442.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="256" caption="Bitter Fruit Juice"]<img class=" " title="Bitter Fruit Juice" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/34480-2/P1120438.JPG" alt="" width="256" height="384" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="Lettuce Wraps"]<img class=" " title="Lettuce Wraps" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/34531-2/P1120456.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="Vegan Chocolate Brownie"]<img class=" " title="Pumpkin with Curry Rice" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/34534-2/P1120457.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" /><br/><div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 394px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img title="Vegan Chocolate Brownie" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/34859-2/P1120582.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]<br/><br/></dt><dd class="wp-caption-dd">Pumpkin with Curry Rice</dd></dl></div>
