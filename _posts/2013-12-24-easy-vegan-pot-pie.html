This recipe is super easy, vegan and soy free. It can probably be gluten free with a different crust on top, so try out different ingredients and have fun! This is a perfect vegan Thanksgiving or Christmas meal for the whole family!<br/><br/>2 TB olive oil<br/>1 large yellow onion chopped<br/>3 garlic cloves diced<br/>2 large Russet potatoes peeled and cubed<br/>2 large carrots cubed<br/>1 can small peas<br/>1 head of broccoli cut into bite sizes<br/>1/4 flour<br/>2 TB nutritional yeast<br/>2 TB Braggs liquid amino<br/>1 1/4 cup vegetable broth<br/>2 tsp herbes de provence<br/>1 tsp crushed black pepper<br/>1 9" rolled pie crust (buy or make your own)<br/><br/>Preheat oven 400 degrees Fahrenheit<br/><br/>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and cook onion and garlic until onion is translucent. Then, put in the carrots and cook for about 2 minutes while mixing every so often. Next, put in the potatoes and cook turning every so often until potatoes are tender but not mushy. Next, put in flour, nutritional yeast, and liquid aminos and then the vegetable broth to create a gravy and mix around for a couple seconds. Mix in the broccoli, peas, and spices in. Turn off skillet heat.<br/><br/>Place the entire mix in the pot (either a large pot (ramekin) or individual smaller pots). Place the dough on top of each pot and place in oven for 30 minutes. Cover the sides of the dough with foil if it begins to brown too much. Serve immediately and enjoy!<br/><br/><br/>Serves 4.<br/>Takes around 20 minutes to prepare, 30 minutes to bake - 50 minutes total.
