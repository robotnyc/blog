I made this recipe up after ruining many eggplants by trying to fry or bake them. I am impatient with eggplant, and I realized, its better to walk away and let it work its magic for you:<br /><br /><strong>Amazing Roasted Eggplant Indian Food (Vegan and Gluten Free)</strong><br /><ul><br /><li>2 or 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge eggplants</li><br /><li>1/2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yellow onion</li><br /><li>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garlic cloves, minced</li><br /><li>1 can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chopped tomatoes</li><br /><li>1/2 tsp: Cumin, turmeric, garlic powder, fennel seeds, chili powder (and whatever else you can throw in there)</li><br /><li>1 tsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Masala Curry</li></ul><br />Preheat oven to 475 F. Cut each eggplant into quarters lengthwise and stab a fork a couple times into each piece. Drizzle each piece in olive oil and rub the oil on the entire eggplant. Place all of the eggplant pieces in a cake pan (or 2) with walls. Roast in oven for 40 minutes - half way through, flip the eggplants over to brown both sides (very important!). The eggplant should be very soft, and the skin should almost fall off.<br /><br />Once the eggplant is done, take them out of the cake pans and set aside. Let them cool for a couple minutes. Chop the onion and garlic. Peel the eggplant skins off and discard. Chop the eggplant into smaller pieces about 2 inches wide.<br /><br />Pour 2 Tbsp olive oil in pan and put on high heat. Cook the onion for a couple minutes, and then the garlic. Once the onion is translucent, put in the eggplant and stir in the spices. Cook the eggplant for a couple minutes and then pour in the tomatoes.&nbsp;Stir, and lower the heat to simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until it tastes good/you are too impatient. Done!<br /><br />You can serve with rice, naan, quinoa, or alone.<br /><br />
