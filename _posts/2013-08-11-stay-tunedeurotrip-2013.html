Our 2nd European adventure will commence at the end of this month, so stay tuned for vegan restaurant and food scavenging tips in France, Sweden, and Norway. We're starting the trip in Lucas' homeland and ending in mine.<br/><br/>Our trip starts in the Loire Valley (100 miles south of Paris) where there are NO English reviews of vegan food. I'm jumping blindly, and the options are very slim. However, I will either come out writing about our experience, or show up dead from starvation - stay tuned! The Loire is known for beautiful, romantic castles and also wine! So we will have some picturesque photos and have great <del>Champagne</del> sparkling wine to fuel our trip. We'll be traveling to many stops around that weekend with our French friend/tour guide, so it should be an amazing couple days.<br/><br/>The next stop is Paris for the next couple days. We will stop by the obligatory Loving Hut, Gentle Gourmet, MOB, Maoz, and much more. In between trips to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, we will be walking the city looking for great markets, neighborhoods, and restaurants, and meeting the local people.<br/><br/>We then fly off to Stockholm to visit Lucas' friend, Kris. I'm not sure what to expect in Stockholm at all. They claim to be the most veg-friendly city in Europe? We'll see if that rumor is true. They drink more more than anyone in the world (behind Finnland), so instead of drinking wine at breakfast, lunch and dinner, like in France, we will be wired off fika (coffee). We can relax on some comfortable Malms at Ikea after the caffeine crash.<br/><br/>Finally, we'll be in Oslo for a quick trip to my homeland. I was hoping to visit my long-lost relatives, but I will most likely seeing where the great grandparents are from without any contacts. I'm hoping to spot some wildlife and head down to Drobak to where my family is from to see where Santa Clause came from. Food will most likely be tough, but we'll be in the big city - and some curry will probably get us by as usual.<br/><br/>I'm studying my French, so bon chance to me and my weak French skills navigating the meat loving Frenchie population. If I don't get the stink eye from a waiter, I will be very disappointed.
