<div>This is a adaptation of the double chocolate chip cookie recipe from Babycakes. I made it non-gluten free and changed the flax for banana. You can also just add another 1/4 cup applesauce instead of banana too. These recipes can be a little oily, so check the consistency and adjust as necessary.</div><div><br /></div>1 Cup Coconut Oil<div>1 1/4 cup unbleached sugar</div><div>1/3 cup applesauce</div><div>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</div><div>1 tsp salt</div><div>2 TB vanilla extract</div><div>1 1/2 cups unbleached flour</div><div>1 tsp baking soda</div><div>1 ripe banana</div><div>1 cup vegan chocolate chips (try Ghirardelli)&nbsp;</div><div>1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</div><div><br /></div><div>Mix all the dry ingredients together in one bowl (cocoa, flour, salt, baking soda, sugar). Smash the banana in another bowl and then mix all the wet ingredients together with it (oil, applesauce, vanilla). Then, mix the wet ingredients into the dry bowl and fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts.</div><div><br /></div><div>Scoop up 1 inch balls of dough and place 1 inch apart from each other on the baking sheet. Bake the cookies on the center rack for 14 minutes, rotate the cookie sheet 180 degrees and cook another 9 minutes. Check the books to make sure they are crisp on the outside.</div><div><br /></div><div>Take them out of the oven and let rest for 10 minutes.&nbsp;</div>
