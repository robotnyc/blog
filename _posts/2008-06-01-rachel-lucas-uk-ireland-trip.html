In August we are traveling to Dublin, Ireland to Caroline &amp; Gavin's wedding. After spending four days there, we are heading by ferry to the U.K. for five days. We are putting together a traveling website with our itinerary and pictures. Please visit it to follow us on our adventure this summer!<br/><br/><a class="alignleft" title="Our Travel Site" href="http://www.tripit.com/people/Mzzroboto" target="_blank">http://www.tripit.com/people/Mzzroboto</a>
