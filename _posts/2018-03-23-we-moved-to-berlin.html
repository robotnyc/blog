A lot of people were surprised by our move - but mostly jealous. However, this is something we have wanted to do for basically forever. Almost every year, we would take our one big vacation in Europe. We always travel how a local does - we stay in Air BnBs, cook at home, go to meetups, and hang out like we would in LA. That way we can get a good feeling for how living in the city would be. Paris is beautiful but too traditional/strict, Italy is amazing and relaxing but tech is way behind, Scandinavia&nbsp;is cool but didn't blow us away...but Berlin was so different.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">We heard the rumors and stats of Berlin and it hit everything on the&nbsp;Ãœber Checklist - most green city, most vegan city, super tech startup city, English-friendly, family&nbsp;friendly, no Trump, etc. So a</span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">fter years of being Euro-curious, we made the leap and moved here.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>What's It Like?</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Americans don't know much about Germany except the stereotypes. I was told I would only be able to eat sausage and beer, and that everyone is cold. After visiting and moving here, I can definitely say that both are ridiculous generalizations. Similar to saying Americans only eat hot dogs and smile too much - kind of true - but too simplified.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">In reality, LA and Berlin are similar in a lot of ways - and in many ways they are different. Both cities are a bubble - they have liberal, alternative people mostly living in them, there is always something to do, there is great food, culture, and people. Berliners have been more friendly, social, and open-minded than their LA counterparts. Even just this week, we have met lots of friends, went to an impromptu&nbsp;dinner with four people we just met, and met people from all over the world doing something similar to us.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">For the day-to-day, I find Berlin to be much safer, QUIETER, super walkable, and healthier.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Safety - no weekly school shootings, drugged up transients in my doorway, and even small children take the subway alone with no problem.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Senses - It's so quiet it's actually scary/I love it. LA was ridiculously loud. With the constant helicopters or screaming people in the streets, neighbors with loud music and TVs until 2am.. Berlin is super quiet. Ride the subway at rush hour in a packed car and people are whispering&nbsp;and no one is playing a loud boombox. At home, it's so peaceful I don't think anyone is alive. For the smell - I'm not missing Eau de LA (weed/urine/body sweat mix) in all the streets...but that always reminds me of home.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Walkable - I lost 3 pounds during this week, just living like a German. I don't have a car and I have a mini-fridge (aka a normal German size fridge). So I am walking everywhere and going to my local store a few times a week. I only get the necessities to cook for the next few days and don't waste anything.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Health - Everyone is really healthy here - except for the constant smoking/drinking. We went to a local hackerspace on the weekend where we all stopped what we were doing at 5pm, walked to the store, bought groceries and cooked a healthy vegetable stir fry and salad together. The other hackerspace cooked a vegan tomato soup for everyone last time we were here. The food doesn't have as much added sugar as the US so we've reduced our salt and sugar intake by just leaving the states. We can even walk across the street and get a healthy homemade vegan meal or hearty soup for 4 euro any time of day.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Final Thoughts for Now</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">So far I'm really liking my new town. I really needed a change and even though I wanted to take a Trump detox (which isn't working because he's prolific) I'm loving the lifestyle here. I'm excited for 6 weeks of vacations, summertime, and more fun events to meet all the amazing people here.&nbsp;</span>
