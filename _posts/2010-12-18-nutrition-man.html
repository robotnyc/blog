The other day I was shopping at my local Henry's Market in the organic vegetables section. I happend to meet up at the brocoli with a 67 year old man that is a nutritionist. He gave me some great pointers and really stressed having lots of raw foods in your diet. After a long and interesting conversation on my vegan health (he mentioned God ate fish so that's why he does - but that's the only meat he eats - but God also didn't eat the processed, hormone and metal filled fish we eat today) and only mentioned to be careful of the B12 and omega 3s - which I have heard before, but was glad to hear that was the only thing to worry about.<br/><br/>The interesting thing I wanted to pass on was the numbering system on fruits and vegetables:<br/><br/>A fruit or vegetable that starts with a <strong>4</strong> has pestisides in the growing process. For example, a banana would be 4011.<br/><br/>A fruit or vegetable that starts with a<strong> 9</strong> is organically grown. For example, that same banana would be 94011.<br/><br/>A fruit or vegetable that starts with an<strong> 8</strong> is GMO (genetically modified organism). That mutant banana is now 84011.<br/><br/>Check out the <a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/eat-safe/Dirty-Dozen-Foods" target="_blank">dirty dozen</a> if you are not aware of the dangers of eating pesticides and/or are not ready to switch to organic. After eating locally grown organic fruits and vegetables I feel it tastes better because it is not ripening in a truck that has traveled 5,000 miles to get to my plate. Local and less chemicals usually taste better and won't let you grow that extra eye ball or lose you <a href="http://www.raw-wisdom.com/50harmful." target="_blank">sterility</a>.<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Fruit Stickers"]<img title="Fruit Stickers" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1187/1045388270_038983e659.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" />[/caption]
