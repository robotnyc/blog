<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This is an updated version of my 2014 LA Walking Tour with the same purpose but with updated fun things to do!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">I have a common walk in downtown LA that I like to do and decided to put my common walk and food, drink and shopping spots on a map. In between this walking tour there are amazing views of downtown, the arts district, and less views of creepy-town USA spots and "pee-pee" corners (no joke). This is a fun walk that I bring my visitors when they want to see our favorite spots in LA. Have fun! See my notes below the map for secret tips!</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><iframe height="480" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1_hV2zpNaNqSN9nya2WD7rceWEgE&amp;hl=en" width="640"></iframe></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A. <b>Union Station:</b> Beautiful, historic train station. Walk in the halls and stare at the ceiling. Don't forget to see the outside gardens too!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">B. <b>Olvera Street:</b> This is literally the oldest place in Los Angeles and has cute Mexican markets, an old church, and even a cemetery. Pick up a sombrero for the rest of your walk, why not?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">C.<b> Burgerlords:</b> Pick up the most fantastic vegan burger with vegan animal fries in Chinatown. Oh yea, there's Chinatown there too! They film a ton of shows and movies in this location, so enjoy.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">D. <b>Grand Park:</b> Grand Park is a wonderful, newish park right in DTLA. They have tons of free events for music and food, so check out their site to see the schedule or you may just walk into a cool event by mistake.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">E. <b>Grand Central Market:</b> Yes, this place is also historic and really cool now. Honestly, I didn't go here much until they changed up some of the restaurants for new ones like Ramen Hood (all vegan ramen!) and Golden Road (brewery with amazing pub pretzel, vegan mac&amp;cheese, and perogis!) and the best coffee in LA, G&amp;B (get their almond/macadamia nut milk sweetened latte - iced. You will be very happy.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">F. <b>Angel City Brewery:</b> You just ate and got hopped up on coffee, so grab a beer too! Bring your dog and baby too apparently.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">G.<b> Shojin:</b> Take a walk around Little Tokyo and the Arts District, and then you'll be starving and can head over to the best vegan Japanese restaurant ever. They have the best sushi and ramen, and don't forget dessert.. Pomegranate makes it, and it's fancy and good.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">H. <b>Poketo:</b> Fine, I'll put some non-food stuff. This place is cute and you should go.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I. <b>Van Leeuwen Artisanal Ice Cream:</b> They have 10 flavors of bomb vegan ice cream and can even do sundaes. Enough said.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">J. <b>Stumptown Coffee:</b> Portland's best coffee shop is in LA too. Now you don't have to quit your job and live the vagabond life, just go into far-off DTLA.</span>
