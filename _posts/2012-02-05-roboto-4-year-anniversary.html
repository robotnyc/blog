On February 1st Lucas and I celebrated our four year anniversary. We started dating in 2008 at a time that became extremely stressful, yet an exhilerating time. Not many people understood the reason for my departure to a new boyfriend, a new career, and a new life at the time. I knew something durastic about my life had to happen though, and meeting Lucas allowed me to break free of the rut I was sitting in. He motivated me to tear down the barriers of my Norcoian life and do things that pushed my limits.<br/><br/>I had no idea where I wanted to be, what I wanted to do with my life, and what was next five years ago. But now I sit here finishing my last week of college, starting my green belt six sigma certification, and working hard in a career that I fought to have. I'm more excited for the next four years together and know from these past years that I will move past my previous expectations and we will do it together.<br/><br/>We have learned a lot, changed a lot, and had a lot of fun together. I'm excited to see what comes out of the next four years and the many adventures to come.<br/><br/>This is a recap of the last four years:<br/><br/>We traveled to London, Dublin, China, San Francisco, and New York<br/><br/>I finished my business degree<br/><br/>I started my career in process design and six sigma<br/><br/>Lucas started his masters in computer engineering<br/><br/>We went from omnivores to vegan<br/><br/>We bought a Leaf<br/><br/>We moved three times<br/><br/>We took 10,000<a href="http://robotnyc.com/gallery" target="_blank"> photos</a>
