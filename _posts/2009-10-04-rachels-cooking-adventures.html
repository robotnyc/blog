Today I made my fourth vegan dessert creation from babycakes, pumpkin muffins! They turned out really moist, tasty and healthy! The vegan chocolate chip cookies and double chocolate chip cookies went over really well at work too. I'm happy to spread the vegan, gluten-free, sugar free lovlieness to the world!<br/><br/>After my growing knowledge of GMO's (genetically modified organisms) it is more apparent that we all need to eat less meat and more organic everything. The horrors that Monsanto, the maker of agent orange, does to our food is outrageous and eating this organic, vegan dessert is that more satisfying knowing that I am not supporting their hostile endeavors!<br/><br/>
