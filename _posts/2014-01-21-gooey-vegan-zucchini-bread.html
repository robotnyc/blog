This recipe has lots of zucchini which makes it a gooey, lovely bread. You can even add chopped walnuts or chocolate chips, or both to make it even better! This uses smashed banana instead of flax because I don't like making poop bread as much as many other vegans, but feel free to sub if you want. <br /><br /><br />1 cup whole wheat flour<br />1 cup unbleached white flour<br />2 tsp baking powder<br />2 tsp baking soda<br />1 tsp sea salt<br />2 tsp cinnamon<br />1 tsp cardamom<br />1/2 cup coconut oil<br />1 ripe banana smashed<br />1 TB vanilla ext.<br />3/4 cup almond/rice milk<br />1/2 cup agave<br />2 cups shredded zucchini<br />1 cup walnuts<br />1/2 cup (or up to 1 cup) chocolate chips<br /><br />Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease a bread pan and set aside.<br /><br />Take two bowls, one for dry and one for wet ingredients. For the dry, mix in: flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom. In the wet bowl, smash the banana with a potato smasher until smooth. Add coconut oil, vanilla extract, almond milk, and agave. Mix dry and wet ingredients together. Mix in zucchini. Add walnuts or chocolate chips if desired. <br /><br />Pour mix into bread pan and cook for 40 minutes or until knife comes out clean.<br /><br />Serve warm with some Earth Balance on top for an extra treat! Enjoy!
