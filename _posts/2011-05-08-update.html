I haven't written here in a while, so here is an update on what we've been up to..<br/><br/>We've planned a trip to NYC to see Lucas' mom and sister in May for a week. I'll finally get to see the nice weather, parks, shopping, and of course tons of vegan restaurants.<br/><br/>We're both going to school right now, Lucas doing his masters in computer engineering. I'm in my senior year of business information systems and they agreed to the dual concentration in ISCOM.<br/><br/>We're planning the DEFcon trip in August, should be a geeky fun time.<br/><br/>I've made millions of more recipes and have gone to a couple Native Foods Cooking demos. Recently made some vegan tamales from scratch which was pretty great!<br/><br/>We attended BarcampLA8 in April. There hasn't been a barcampLA in 2 years &amp; now there is a fee, so it was quite small, but still fun and interesting. We met some fellow vegans and geeks in the area and met up with some old friends from past Barcamps.<br/><br/>We're starting a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) drop-off at work so we can support Tanaka Farms in Irvine and get organic produce dropped off once a week to the employees.<br/><br/>More to come!
