Seitan<br/><br/>4 cups  unbleached flour<br/><br/>1 cup whole wheat flour<br/><br/>1 cup vital gluten flour<br/><br/>mix all flours together in a large bowl, and slowly add in water. Once mixed, knead 70 times on a flat, floured surface. Let sit for 20 minutes. Next, lay the ball of dough in the bowl again and put the bowl in the sink to rinse and knead 10 more times. So, rinse, knead (you’ll see a cloudy substance come out which is the carbohydrates being extracted. This is what you want so you only have gluten in the end- all the protein will remain). After 10 rinses your water will be more clear and you will be able to take the dough out.<br/><br/>Next, you will make the seitan broth..<br/><br/>Seitan broth<br/><br/>10 cups water<br/><br/>2 cups soy sauce<br/><br/>8 cloves peeled garlic<br/><br/>3 2″ slides of ginger<br/><br/>4  bay leaves<br/><br/>Put all the ingredients together in a very large pot and simmer. Wrap the seitan in cheese cloth tightly and put into the pot. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 1.5 hours.<br/><br/><img class="aligncenter" title="Seitan!" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/38524-1/P1140951.JPG" alt="" width="640" height="480" />
