Today I made a glorious old French recipe the vegan way. It took many hours but it was well worth it and I will share the recipe so you can enjoy in the deliciousness of it too!<br/><br/>We went to a Native Foods cooking demo with the creator, Chef Tanya, a couple weeks ago in Tustin. She is writing a new book on Mom's and Grandma's recipes made the vegan way. We had some samples and a cooking demo on them and the food was to die for. I ended up falling in love with the Beefy Bourguignon stew that she let us try because it was so similar to a beef stew and no animal carcass included! It was instead made with seitan an ancient recipe of a pure gluten loaf made from flour and water that creates a super-protein that is good for you and vegan!<br/><br/>I also wanted to show Lucas' mom the perfect way to make vegan food at home and still have that old French flavor with fresh veggies and rich flavors.<br/><br/>So, first you start making the seitan:<br/><br/><strong>Seitan </strong><br/><br/>4 cups  unbleached flour<br/><br/>1 cup whole wheat flour<br/><br/>1 cup vital gluten flour<br/><br/>mix all flours together in a large bowl, and slowly add in water. Once mixed, knead 70 times on a flat, floured surface. Let sit for 20 minutes. Next, lay the ball of dough in the bowl again and put the bowl in the sink to rinse and knead 10 more times. So, rinse, knead (you'll see a cloudy substance come out which is the carbohydrates being extracted. This is what you want so you only have gluten in the end- all the protein will remain). After 10 rinses your water will be more clear and you will be able to take the dough out.<br/><br/>Next, you will make the seitan broth..<br/><br/><strong>Seitan broth</strong><br/><br/>10 cups water<br/><br/>2 cups soy sauce<br/><br/>8 cloves peeled garlic<br/><br/>3 2" slides of ginger<br/><br/>4  bay leaves<br/><br/>Put all the ingredients together in a very large pot and simmer. Once the seitan is done, plop the seitan in the pot with a skewer in the middle. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 1.5 hours.<br/><br/>Last, you will make the stew...<br/><br/><strong>Beefy Bourguignon</strong><br/><br/>1/3 cup olive oil<br/><br/>1 large sliced carrot<br/><br/>1 large yellow onion<br/><br/>1 pkg. boiling onions<br/><br/>1 lb. mushrooms (any kind)<br/><br/>2 cloves garlic peeled<br/><br/>1 tsp. salt<br/><br/>1/4 tsp.  black pepper<br/><br/>3 lbs. seitan cut into 1/2" pieces<br/><br/>2 Tbsp.  flour<br/><br/>2 cups dry red wine<br/><br/>3 cups water<br/><br/>2 vegan vegetable bouillon cubes (no salt added)<br/><br/>1 Tbsp.  tomato paste<br/><br/>1/2 tsp. dried thyme<br/><br/>1  bay leaf<br/><br/>1 cup chopped Italian parsley<br/><br/>1. In a large soup pot heat olive oil and add carrot, onion, boiling onions, mushrooms, garlic, salt and pepper and saute until transparent and lightly browned.<br/><br/>2. Add the seitan pieces for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.<br/><br/>3. Add the flour and stir well to cover all ingredients and let brown slightly (2-3 min).<br/><br/>4. Stir in wine and water. Crumble and add vegan vegetable bouillon cubes, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaf.<br/><br/>5. Let simmer on low, partially covered for 1 hour.<br/><br/>6. Serve, place parsley on top of decoration<br/><br/>Bon apetit!<br/><br/>[gallery orderby="title"]
