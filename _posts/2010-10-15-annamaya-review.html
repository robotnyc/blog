We met up with a friend from the Shanghai Veggie Club at Annamaya, a completely vegan restaurant in downtown Shanghai. It was only about 4 blocks from where we are staying and it was a nice walk and easy to find. The decor and architecture were interesting. It has an Indian or natural feel inside. It has high ceilings and is clean and comfortable.<br/><br/>We started with the mustard pumpkin salad. This was spectacular. I highly recommend this dish. It was pumpkin and I think potato chunks in a light mustard sauce and sprinked with pumpkin seeds. This was laying over a bed of fresh lettuce. It was refreshing and delicious.<br/><br/>We also tried the veggie burger. This was more of a hummus sandwich to me, and was pretty good, but I still preferred the pumpkin dish by far. We tried some vegan deserts as well. Our friend had the cheese cake with figs on top. It was perfect and tasted like the real thing. We had a rich chocolate cake made with tofu. It was very rich, but creamy and really good.<br/><br/>The owner was one of the best parts of the restaurants. Kazu is a Japanese woman who also speaks perfect Chinese and English. She explained all of the dishes, recommended what to eat, and talked about vegan life in Shanghai with us. I highly recommend coming to Annamaya, this is not a typical Chinese restaurant and everything is safe to eat, clean and the staff is friendly. The boast not having the mock meats as well, so if you are looking for that come here for sure.<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="448" caption="Pumpkin Mustard DishVeggie Burger"]<a href="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/v/China+2010/"><img title="Pumpkin Mustard Dish" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/32827-2/P1110832.JPG" alt="" width="448" height="299" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="448" caption="Vegan Chocolate Cake"]<img title="Vegan Chocolate Cake" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/32842-2/P1110844.JPG" alt="" width="448" height="299" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="448" caption="Vegan Cheesecake"]<img title="Vegan Cheesecake" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/32848-2/P1110848.JPG" alt="" width="448" height="299" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="448" caption="Us with Kazu"]<img title="Us with Kazu" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/32854-2/P1110850.JPG" alt="" width="448" height="299" />[/caption]
