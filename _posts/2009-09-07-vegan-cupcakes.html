I got a new recipe book called <em>Babycakes</em> and it is vegan, gluten-free and mostly sugar-free. The whole thing is animal friendly, no preservatives and ALL desserts! I got the book at Borders and two days later I get go on my cupcake fiasco because it is extremly hard to find anything vegan/non-gluten or perservative-free these days.<br/><br/>It gave me the idea of my future entrepreneurship opportunity in the sustainable living, vegan, green industry that I would love way too much. It would include free workshops to bring in the community and teach people how to live sustainably too.<br/><br/>This book reminded me that I could completely live my dream, eat desserts all day and work as my own boss of the cupcake world as I have a family and travel the world on my vega-cake diet and budget. All dreams aside I will do my little experiment to turn everyone to the dark side of vegan-healthy desserts tomorrow at work!<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="120" caption="cupcake of love"]<img title="Vega-Cupcake!!" src="http://www.babycakesnyc.com/assets_c/2009/09/cupcake-thumb-180x157.jpg" alt="cupcake of love" width="120" height="105" />[/caption]
