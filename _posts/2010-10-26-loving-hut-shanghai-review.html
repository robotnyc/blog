Loving Hut in Shanghai was amazingly cheap and good food. We frequent the Loving Hut in Orange, CA at least three times a week so we traveled out to see how this restaurant compared. The menu, of course, was completely different. Everything was made Chinese style including what we ordered: fake fish, faux meat dumplings, fresh fruit juice and sweet and sour chick'n. The dumplings were a hit, at only about $1 for the whole plate of around 15 dumplings, this was a steal. They are hand made and they have fake meat and vegetables. The juice was really good, but like at most Chinese restaurants they usually cost more than a whole plate of food. The fake fish was done really well, but was not our style. It tasted too much like fish and I was never a big fish person in the past, but I would still recommend this dish to fish lovers. The sweet and sour chicken was more sour with a vinegar taste. It came with free white rice and a soup with seaweed.<br/><br/>The best thing about this restaurant was the employee we met. He spoke perfect English and talked about their food, their philosophy, the location and other restaurants to try (he recommended JuJuBe Tree because it is about the only restaurant except their's that is actually vegan, thanks Xu!)<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="Sweet and Sour Chick&#39;n"]<img class=" " title="Sweet and Sour Chick'n" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/32698-2/P1110784.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="Faux Meat Dumplings"]<img class=" " title="Faux Meat Dumplings" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/32722-2/P1110792.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]<br/><br/><div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 394px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img class=" " title="Lucas and his drinks" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/32695-2/P1110783.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="256" /></dt> </dl></div>
