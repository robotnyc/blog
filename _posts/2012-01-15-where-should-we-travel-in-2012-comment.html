I am trying to chose a place to travel this year (and of course do my food blogging) and I need your help! Please post a comment of a location where you think we should travel. Currently, the options are:<br/><br/>Yucatan, Mexico - For the Mayan ruins<br/><br/>Paris, France - Baguettes, music festivals, Frenchies<br/><br/>Toronto or Vancouver, Canada - America, but not.<br/><br/>Portland, Oregon - Hippies, "vegan city of the US", and Portlandia<br/><br/>Hong Kong - China, but not.<br/><br/>Machu Picchu - Wonder of the world, similar to Pikachu<br/><br/>...Other...??
