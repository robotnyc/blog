Back To Eden Bakery in Portland, OR is my favorite bakery of all time. They have great &nbsp;lattes, baked goods, breakfast, and amazing soft serve ice cream. I went there twice for the weekend I was there and got one or more of each of these categories! Everything is vegan and gluten-free and homemade!<br /><br />In order of amazingnes:<br />The sausage/biscuit breakfast bowl: This consists of all homemade ingredients including a biscuit, sausage, and gravy. It was extremely good and there is nothing else like it.<br /><br />Soft serve ice cream banana split: I got the banana split with chocolate/vanilla ice cream, marshmallows, and caramel. This was the best dessert and ice cream I've ever had!<br /><br />Baked goods: everything is good here from the savory to the sweet. We had the tempeh broccoli quiche, tempeh bacon scone, and some type of nutty donut. Everything was seriously amazing again.<br /><br />I've been to vegan bakeries everywhere, but they just do it better here. Plus, when you're on Alberta street, check out the cute stores and other delights in the neighborhood. Next door is the grilled cheese truck that makes homemade cashew cheese grilled cheese and mac and cheese that is also worth the trip from LA!
