We found a new hiking spot with waterfalls, nature and wolves just 30 minutes from Anaheim in a town near Pasadena, called Arcadia. After a steep 2 mile drive up a winding and beautiful mountain, you come to the hiking trails with a couple paths and not too many people around. It makes you feel like you are hundreds of miles away from LA when we are just around the corner! It's a great hike and has many skilled levels, but mostly you better be ready with your boots and some sort of endurance to climb some of these steep trails.<br/><br/>The best thing we found were the nice waterfalls and swimming ponds. The water is absolutely freezing, clean and refreshing (which I can't say for most of the beaches we swim in). We found a little cove after we climbed a steep cliff past the 30 foot waterfall. Up stream was a quiet, peaceful pool and a nice medium sized waterfall filling it. After the mind numbingly cold water wore off (I got too numb to feel it anymore) we enjoyed nature and the robust butterfly hideout near us.<br/><br/>All in all, a great hike and definitely something to check out if you're in the LA/OC area and want to get away. Try to find the vegetarian option on the cliff where you buy the parking pass. The first time we went there was free veggie sausage sandwiches! The next time they were gone, but they were making veggie burgers - so not bad!<br/><br/><wpg2>30085</wpg2><wpg2>30097</wpg2><wpg2>30143</wpg2><wpg2>30200</wpg2><wpg2>30230</wpg2><wpg2>30248</wpg2><wpg2>30254</wpg2>
