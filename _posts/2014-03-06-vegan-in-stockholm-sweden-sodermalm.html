For the rest of the Swedish trip, we spent days walking through Sodermalm, the hipster downtown of Stockholm. With the beautiful cobblestone streets, random vegan buffets and bakeries, stunning Swedish art and shopping, and the views of Stockholm - it was our favorite place to walk.<br /><br />We ate at <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews/chutney-stockholm-1177">Chutney</a> - which is absolutely amazing Indian food with the Swedish style buffet. You get unlimited chutney, Swedish bread and vegetables, coffee and tea with up to two plates of amazing food. It was so good we ate their for lunch and dinner the same day! I still miss the food to this day. They have desserts as well, which are ok but not amazing- the meals were better.<br /><br />We also happened to see a vegetarian buffet lunch spot while looking for a half-vegan bakery. <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews/vegetariskt-matcafe-legume-stockholm-1183">Vegetariskt Matcafe Legume</a> was 90% vegan and was similar to the Chutney buffet style of super healthy, good, Indian and Mediterranean food with free coffee and bread.<br /><br />I also heard about a bakery that had many vegan options. <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews/naturbageriet-sattva-stockholm-1198">Naturbageriet Sattva</a>&nbsp;was a complete surprise for me. I walked a long way to find it, and when I finally found it, I was kind of disappointed. It looked like a really boring natural bakery - which the name means basically - natural bakery purity (sattva = purity in sanskrit). The place was very minimal and the baked goods were in one small fridge. They looked really blah (like most Swedish desserts: flat, to the point). Since I walked the whole way there, I still loaded up on almost every vegan dessert anyway. I grabbed a cinnamon roll, cakes and cookies, everything. The lady was very nice. She was surprised we were not Swedish because she said every foreigner comes in with a massive backpack (probably all the vegan travelers on a trek from Happy Cow). She explained how an American Buddhist helped make some of the recipes. We walked out of there, packed the desserts away and didn't even try them until that night. To my surprise - they were AMAZING! They were to die for and I gobbled them up with our friend's parents. Lesson: Don't judge a dessert by it's boring exterior!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5341/9862714784_3ca3da96ab_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5341/9862714784_3ca3da96ab_n.jpg" /></a></div><br />
