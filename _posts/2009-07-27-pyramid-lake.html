Lucas and I took a trip up to Pyramid Lake last Saturday with Brooke and Martin. We rode around on their boat watching the mountains and trees go by as we skimmed on the huge lake. We could barely tell we right outside LA except for the glooming 5 freeway in the distance. There weren't that many people on the lake for how beautiful it was out there that day.<br/><br/>There were some classy, tattooed, white guys blaring gangsta' rap that you could hear from a mile away so we blared ABBA to drown out the profanely-lame music. We ate, talked and swam the day away and traveled to small coves, even seeing the pyramid landmark.<br/><br/>As the cool water refreshed us on the warm day, the sun beat down on our backs and crisped our flesh until it grew red and burnt. We watched the flaming-red dragonflies as they sped past the water and complemented the green algae and seaweeds that swayed in the slow current. A big wake would throw the boat around once in a while as a few jetskis and boat-pulled donuts sped past us.<br/><br/>We tiredly said goodbye and drove the long distance home to watch a movie on the projector, Adventureland, and it was quite surprisingly good and realistic. It gave me reminisces of the old Disneyland days and oh, how I'm so glad I'm out of there. Next stop, Vegas. and my week off from school!<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="288" caption="Pyramid Lake (click on picture for rest of Pyramid Lake photos..)"]<a href="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/v/southern_california-2009/pyramidlake-20090725/"><img title="Pyramid Lake" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/25183-2/p1070835.jpg" alt="Pyramid Lake (click on picture for rest of Pyramid Lake photos..)" width="288" height="192" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="alignright" width="288" caption="Lucas and his boat ho&#39;s"]<a href="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/v/southern_california-2009/pyramidlake-20090725/"><img class=" " title="Lucas, Brooke and Rachel" src="http://www.magasweran.com/gallery/d/25084-2/p1070794.jpg" alt="Lucas and his boat hos" width="288" height="192" /></a>[/caption]
