I have a feeling that 2012 will be a good year. This year I am focusing on change. In 2011 I graduated and got a new job. Two huge accomplishments that I have acknowledged but have just made me want to pursue more. Before I was in school I didn't think I would be able to attain as much as I have in this year. One of my major goals was to work for a company who dealt with climate change or energy and do lean or six sigma work. Now that I have attained that goal so quickly, I am left to create new stretch goals that I can pursue in the next year, five years, and ten years. I have started by thinking about what is important in my life, where I want to be, and when. I then created a bucket list or BID list. I want to fulfill my personal life with adventure and travel goals, I want to fulfill myself with an advancing career, and eventually have a family. Basically, I am anxious and impatient to get everything at once, but I'm planning for the future where I can only have one or a couple things at a time.<br/><br/>This year we are thinking BIG. 2012 Mayan big. And you have to ask yourself the question. If the Mayans were right, would you be happy come December if the world ended? I wouldn't. So I'm looking to take some risks, pursue my curiosity, and challenge myself to see how far I can push it this year. Living and working abroad? Traveling the world? Learning a coding language? Learning French? I'm going to try it all or at least attempt.
