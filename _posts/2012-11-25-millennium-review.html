Millennium is the best upscale vegan food you can possibly have on the west coast. There are not many times you can have a fancy dinner, dress up, sip fancy cocktails, and pick EVERYTHING on the menu! They get booked up pretty fast, so I reserved a spot online and came in on a Saturday night. The restaurant is in the same building as a Best Western Hotel, but don't let that make you think its any less fancy.<br/><br/>I felt very under dressed for the occasion. It was mostly suits and dresses, and each meal was about $30, but it is worth the money and worth putting on your nice clothes for the meal. (There's even fancy foreign men's ponytails to check out during your meal!) You also have the option of doing the pre fixe meal which is a 3 or 4 course meal from appetizers, meal, and desserts for $50 (cheaper on the weekdays - $40). I would chose this option next time I come. This includes some of their most popular dishes that they have been serving for over 17 years - so you know its good.<br/><br/>I tried the Bastilla which is out of this world. It's a puffed pastry with seitan, lentils, squash and apricot and four different sauces. It was really filling and the most interesting item on the menu.<br/><br/>I would absolutely come here again. This place is perfect for a birthday, anniversary, or date night. It's a perfect place for vegans or non-vegans alike, so guys, if your girlfriend is vegan/vegetarian and you have been eating low-end food or salads for months - treat her with this and you be a superstar.<br/><br/>And BTW, who said vegans don't drink - they even have white Russians and vegan Irish creams!
