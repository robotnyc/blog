My family has eaten at Native Foods for over nine years and we absolutely LOVE the wellington they HAD during the holidays. Unfortunately, after probably 25 years of making the amazing vegan main course, they changed their recipe. Their wellington was always at the center of Thanksgiving and Christmas for my family and I looked forward to it all year. It was stuffed with basically all the traditional sides inside a puff pastry, and it was the best thing to happen to the holidays. I really hate Tofurky and fake meat roasts. This wellington doesn't try to be anything like that. It's stuffed with healthy vegetables and seitan in a savory beautiful puff pastry with gravy.

There is no recipe online for anything like this, so I did my best attempt to recreate the recipe from years of eating it! I linked to recipes that you can use for each ingredient, but feel free to change those out for your favorite stuffing, setian, or gravy recipe. 

Serves: 6
Time: A long time to make all the recipes! But 30 min. to cook.

Ingredients:

* Puff pastry (x2 packages)
* 1/2 recipe unflavored* seitan thinly sliced (I used 2 loaves of Viva Vegan's white setian)
* 1/4 recipe [Stuffing](https://www.karissasvegankitchen.com/easy-vegan-stuffing/)
* 2 cups kale shredded into 2" pieces
* 1 cup portobello (or button) mushrooms thinly sliced
* 1 yam thinly sliced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* [Mushroom Gravy](https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-biscuits-and-gravy/)

Instructions:

1. The day before making the wellington, make the seitan and let it cool in the fridge to stiffen up. This is important so it’s not gummy tasting. On the following day, slice the seitan super thin (about 1/8" thick) and set aside.
2. Cook the stuffing and set aside.
3. Steam the kale. Once cool, you can rip it apart a bit. Set aside.
4. Start thawing the puff pastry sheets at room temperature. 
5. Slice the yams (about 1/8" thick) and boil until soft but firm. Set aside.
6. Lay out the thawed puff pastry on a baking sheet on parchment paper. Start stacking the sides in this order: yams, mushroom, seitan, kale, stuffing. 
7. Fold puff pastry sides over to make a sealed log shaped pocket. Flip over so the seam is on the bottom. *Note: I wrapped it in parchment paper and flipped it over to make a sealed paper casing so it wouldn’t fall apart. It held together really well and even browned in the paper.*
8. Bake at 400 F (200 C) degrees for 30 minutes. *Optional: Once 30 min. is up, cut the top of the paper off and brown it even more.*
9. While the wellington is cooking, make the mushroom gravy.
10. Take the wellington out of the oven when the internal temperature reaches 165 F (75 C) and the top is golden brown. Wait 20 minutes for it to slightly cool. Slice it into 1-2" pieces and serve with mushroom gravy!

*I used basically unflavored seitan, but you can use a slightly flavored kind like chick'n flavored etc. Just avoid the packaged kind at the store and especially something that has tons of flavor and seasoning. The rest of the wellington is good enough and doesn't require a strong seitan flavor.
